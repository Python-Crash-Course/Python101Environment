# Python101Environment

Containerized development environment for this organization's Python101 course.

The environment is made with [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and the VS Code's dev-container functionality which works with the [Remote - Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) plugin.

> This is merely an experiment to test if using this is feasible for beginners. Ideally, people will not need to know that they are running in a Docker container, but still get the benefits of having a stable environment.
